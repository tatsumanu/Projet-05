# Projet 05
-----------

The main purpose of this project is to interact with the Openfoodfacts base to find healthier substitute for the user.

First of all, you will need mysql database so, if not already done, download and install mysql from the official website. 
Once done, the program requires a database 'Openfoodfacts' with a unique table we called 'food'. Take it easy as we have already wrote the creation's script for this: just follow this (ADD) and this will be done!

Next, follow the requirements.txt for your virtual environnement. We used Python 3.7.

You will need the database to be populated so, simply run the 'fill_db.py' script.

Once done, you're ready to play the program by running 'main.py'.

Enjoy!

Nota bene: Don't mention it before but please that inside the application, menu and all the stuff will be wrote in french...
